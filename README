Object-KVC version 0.01

DESCRIPTION

Simple Key Value Coding.

Key Value Coding uses a hash key instead of an accessor method to 
access the values of an object.

Values must be wrapped in an object supporting the "equals,"
"contains," and "intersects" methods in order to allow two 
Object::KVC::Hash objects to be compared.

This also Object::KVC::Hash objects to be searched within an
Object::KVC::List.
