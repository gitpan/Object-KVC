Object-KVC version 0.01

DESCRIPTION

Searchable Key Value Coding.

Key Value Coding uses a hash key instead of an accessor method to 
access the values of an object. Key Value Coding is generic; it 
allows a variety of objects to be modeled without having to write
a large number of classes.

The Object::KVC classes are built to allow simple SQL-like searches
and manipulation of "schema-free" data.

The Object::KVC::Hash class values must be wrapped in an object 
supporting the "equals," "contains," and "intersects" methods in 
order to allow two Object::KVC::Hash objects to be compared.

The Object::KVC::Hash search methods are used by the Object::KVC::List
container class to implement the search functionality.

The actual implementation of the value wrapper class search methods
effectively customizes the actual search behaviour.
